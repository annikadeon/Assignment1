    Build an ASP.NET Web App using the same structure as in the "Building First Web App" series of videos. (i.e. Non-MVC)

    Include:

    Title
    Header that lists your preferred name
    A picture of yourself doing something you enjoy
    A paragraph on what you hope to get out of this IS 413 class
    A list of the Top #3 jobs you are most interested in pursuing when you graduate
    A "Grade Calculator" form that takes as input a percentage of each grade category listed in the syllabus
    An icon for the website (#notcoveredinthevideos)

    Build a JavaScript program that calculates and displays both a final percentage and a letter grade using the
    "Grade Calculator" form entries based on the weights listed in the syllabus.

    <p>I am looking forward to this class because I believe it will help me develop a lot of skills I don't have yet, or have not yet "mastered". I am looking forward to learning about a variety of topics, and I think this class will really push me out of my comfort zone. I have enjoyed Professor Hilton's classes so far, so I have high expectations for IS 413! </p>
